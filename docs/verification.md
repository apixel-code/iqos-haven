## Not run or not established

Docker/Compose service execution and real PostgreSQL/Redis integration were not run: this execution environment does not provide Docker or running database/queue services. Consequently the corrected real-database harness, full API/worker dependency lifecycle, provider deployment and runtime grant behavior must be verified locally/CI before accepting the M1 gate. MinIO image digests could not be retrieved from its registry; official release tags and source references are recorded in infra/images.lock.json. Those references still need a successful image pull and execution check.

CI YAML was updated, but no GitHub Actions run was triggered. No real customer email was sent. Commerce race/idempotency/outbox recovery, browser age/cache boundaries, accessibility/visual approval, capacity, staging, production security, backup restore and rollback are pending because the corresponding business modules/infrastructure are not implemented. RPO/RTO remain unmeasured targets.

No milestone gate is declared complete by this foundation suite. Run `pnpm verify -- --integration` after local infrastructure is available, then the feature-specific acceptance cases as implementation proceeds.

## Local infrastructure run — 2026-10-08 (macOS, Node 24.21.0, Docker 29.8.2, Compose v5.5.1)

| Check                           | Result | Scope                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| pnpm install --frozen-lockfile  | PASS   | Node 24.21.0 (Node 25 is rejected by `engines`)                                            |
| pnpm infra:up                   | PASS   | postgres, redis-queue, mailpit healthy; minio up; minio-init exit 0 with 3 private buckets |
| PostgreSQL init roles/databases | PASS   | `ih_owner`, `ih_app`, `ih_test`; `iqos_haven`, `iqos_haven_test`                           |
| pnpm verify -- --integration    | PASS   | All foundation checks plus `test:int` (db 3 tests, api 1 test) against real PG18/Redis     |
| pnpm dev full boot              | PASS   | API live/ready 200 (`database: up`, `queue: up`); storefront/admin pages and `/health` 200 |
| Worker lifecycle                | PASS   | Worker started on `ih-system`, clean SIGTERM shutdown on watch restart                     |

Fixes needed for this run: official MinIO images are no longer publicly pullable from quay.io or Docker Hub, so Compose now pins Chainguard's MinIO and minio-client (`-dev`, has `/bin/sh`) builds by digest (see `infra/images.lock.json`); `turbo.json` sets `concurrency` to 16 because `pnpm dev` starts 11 persistent tasks (default limit 10). Staging, CI run and production-provider checks remain not run.
