# PROGRESS — Iqos Haven

## Current position

- Date: 2026-10-09
- Milestone: M2 — shared reliability, communication and audit foundation (M0 review and M1 staging/fixtures still open)
- Step: 29 (same-origin gateway) — done
- Branch: `step/29-same-origin-gateway` (from `main`)
- See docs/verification.md for actual checks.

## Next action

Run `/step 30`: login/logout/me and session lifecycle (`AuthController`, `SessionService`): `__Host-ih_admin` set from the admin origin (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, Path=/, no Domain), 256-bit token stored as SHA-256, idle 12 h (throttled last_seen) / absolute 7 d, revoke; NFKC-normalize passwords, cap length before argon2 verify, dummy verify for unknown users, generic errors, `needsRehash` upgrade on login. Routes live under `/v1/auth/*` (gateway maps `/api/v1/auth/*` from the admin origin only). Rate limiting is step 32. Pending decision: close the M2 gate. Use node@24 PATH; start Docker Desktop before `pnpm infra:up`.

## Blockers

None for step 27 (schema). BI-11 blocks real Owner bootstrap (28). Email go-live needs the rest of BI-07 (verified Resend domain, sender address, new-order recipients). Audit retention/pruning needs BI-08. BI-07 is partially answered; the other BI items remain open; M0 needs client decisions; M1 staging needs BI-06.

## Gates passed

None closed. M2 gate condition (synthetic event processed by worker; duplicate delivery + Redis job-loss recovery; tests send no real email) is demonstrated locally and in CI (PR #1, run 37818768532); Milestone 2 still has steps 25–26 open. M0/M1 remain open.

- 24 — EffectReconciler, dead listing + audited replay, scheduled_runs + Scheduler, colon-free job IDs; M2 gate demo — 7769a8f

- ci — actions/checkout v7, setup-node v7, pnpm/action-setup v6 (Node 24 runtimes) — b31ad60 (PR #2)
- 25 — email pipeline (strict env, templates, delivery key, EmailConsumer, SMTP/disabled/allowlist adapters, Mailpit in CI) — f35e3dc (PR #4)
- feat — Resend adapter, EMAIL_PROVIDER/RESEND_* config, BI-07 partial + ADR 0004 — PR #5 (c088bb9)
- 26 — @ih/platform storage + HMAC service auth, API InternalService guard, MinIO least-privilege user, MinIO in CI — PR #6 (c786eda)
- 27 — identity schema, explicit Owner/Staff permission seeds, lockable-but-immutable roles — PR #7 (2bbe336)
- 28 — argon2id hasher, password policy, one-time Owner bootstrap CLI, owner-lock trigger — PR #8 (045b544)
- 29 — Caddy same-origin gateway, header stripping, `pnpm test:gateway` (29 checks) in verify/CI — uncommitted (commit `step(29)` follows this handoff)

## Known deviations

- Local MinIO uses Chainguard rebuilds (`cgr.dev/chainguard/minio`, `minio-client:latest-dev`) pinned by digest because official MinIO images are no longer publicly pullable. Still MinIO; production storage provider is decided under BI-06. No ADR needed unless the provider changes.
- Event `consumers` lists only implemented consumers (now `system_probe`); planned ones are documented with roadmap steps and move in with a backfill decision (architecture §8: adding a consumer must not redefine old completions).
- `audit_log` migration revokes UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE only from a role named `ih_app`; other runtime role names must be revoked at provisioning (trigger blocks mutations regardless).

## Last session handoff (2026-10-09, step 29)

Done: step 29. `invariant-reviewer`: no blockers; should-fixes applied (Connection-header abuse check — Caddy is safe; SSE body limit; `/api/age/*` reserved for the storefront age handler; Cloudflare trusted-proxy note for BI-06) and nits (request ID echoed to clients, Linux dev binding documented). One reviewer nit was wrong and reverted: `header -Server/-Via` are needed because Caddy adds its own banner. Compose now runs the gateway on 127.0.0.1:8080/8081.

Files: `infra/gateway/Caddyfile`, `scripts/check-gateway.mjs`, `scripts/verify.mjs`, `docker-compose.yml`, `infra/images.lock.json`, `package.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `README.md`, `docs/{environment,security-boundaries,verification,implementation-status,task-backlog}.md`, `PROGRESS.md`.

Tests: `pnpm verify -- --integration` PASS (unit 224, integration 90, gateway 29).

Unfinished: production gateway/TLS/Cloudflare origin protection (BI-06); age handler (55–56) will use `/api/age/*`; CSRF/Origin checks and limiters are step 32.
