# PROGRESS — Iqos Haven

## Current position

- Date: 2026-10-09
- Milestone: M2 — shared reliability, communication and audit foundation (M0 review and M1 staging/fixtures still open)
- Step: 28 (first-Owner bootstrap + password hashing) — done
- Branch: `step/28-owner-bootstrap` (from `main`)
- See docs/verification.md for actual checks.

## Next action

Run `/step 29`: admin/storefront same-origin gateway and origin routing (gateway/reverse-proxy config: Nest stays private, browser `/api` → Nest `/v1`, cookies/streaming forwarded, browser-supplied trust headers stripped). Gateway technology depends on BI-06 (budget: Caddy/reverse proxy; replicated: ALB) — build the local/dev gateway and tests for routing/header stripping, keep provider specifics behind BI-06. Login (step 30) must NFKC-normalize passwords, cap length before `verify`, and run a dummy verify for unknown users. Pending decision: close the M2 gate. Use node@24 PATH; start Docker Desktop before `pnpm infra:up`.

## Blockers

None for step 27 (schema). BI-11 blocks real Owner bootstrap (28). Email go-live needs the rest of BI-07 (verified Resend domain, sender address, new-order recipients). Audit retention/pruning needs BI-08. BI-07 is partially answered; the other BI items remain open; M0 needs client decisions; M1 staging needs BI-06.

## Gates passed

None closed. M2 gate condition (synthetic event processed by worker; duplicate delivery + Redis job-loss recovery; tests send no real email) is demonstrated locally and in CI (PR #1, run 37818768532); Milestone 2 still has steps 25–26 open. M0/M1 remain open.

- 21 — worker runtime/shutdown, INFO-based noeviction + memory monitor, BullMQ options/prefix, cache≠queue guard — 0375223
- 22 — leased outbox relay (SKIP LOCKED claim, enqueue outside tx, stable job IDs, backoff) — 85d0487
- 23 — EffectRunner (lease claim, one-tx completion, retry/dead, heartbeat, external receipts), DB-clock timestamp defaults — 1781c95
- 24 — EffectReconciler, dead listing + audited replay, scheduled_runs + Scheduler, colon-free job IDs; M2 gate demo — 7769a8f
- fix — DB-clock completion for zero-consumer events, reconciler per-status query + indexes, loopback Redis guard (bug log in docs/verification.md) — 7e879c5
- ci — actions/checkout v7, setup-node v7, pnpm/action-setup v6 (Node 24 runtimes) — b31ad60 (PR #2)
- 25 — email pipeline (strict env, templates, delivery key, EmailConsumer, SMTP/disabled/allowlist adapters, Mailpit in CI) — f35e3dc (PR #4)
- feat — Resend adapter, EMAIL_PROVIDER/RESEND_* config, BI-07 partial + ADR 0004 — PR #5 (c088bb9)
- 26 — @ih/platform storage + HMAC service auth, API InternalService guard, MinIO least-privilege user, MinIO in CI — PR #6 (c786eda)
- 27 — identity schema, explicit Owner/Staff permission seeds, lockable-but-immutable roles — PR #7 (2bbe336)
- 28 — argon2id hasher, password policy, one-time Owner bootstrap CLI, owner-lock trigger — uncommitted (commit `step(28)` follows this handoff)

## Known deviations

- Local MinIO uses Chainguard rebuilds (`cgr.dev/chainguard/minio`, `minio-client:latest-dev`) pinned by digest because official MinIO images are no longer publicly pullable. Still MinIO; production storage provider is decided under BI-06. No ADR needed unless the provider changes.
- Event `consumers` lists only implemented consumers (now `system_probe`); planned ones are documented with roadmap steps and move in with a backfill decision (architecture §8: adding a consumer must not redefine old completions).
- `audit_log` migration revokes UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE only from a role named `ih_app`; other runtime role names must be revoked at provisioning (trigger blocks mutations regardless).

## Last session handoff (2026-10-09, step 28)

Done: step 28. `invariant-reviewer`: no blockers; should-fixes applied (database trigger `staff_users_owner_lock` takes the owner-role lock for every Owner insert/role/active change; hidden prompt handles Ctrl-D, closed stdin and escape sequences; existing-Owner pre-check before prompting) and nits (P2002 → STAFF_EMAIL_TAKEN, parsed `--password-stdin`, NFKC normalization, verify length cap). New dependency: @node-rs/argon2 2.2.2 (prebuilt). Verified on a throwaway database that was dropped — the local dev DB still has no Owner; Marina runs `pnpm bootstrap:owner` with the real Owner (BI-11) when ready.

Tests: `pnpm verify -- --integration` PASS (unit 224, integration 90).

Unfinished: production argon2 tuning (needs the production runtime, BI-06); real Owner creation (BI-11); login/sessions (30); last-Owner service guard (36) can now rely on the trigger-enforced lock.
