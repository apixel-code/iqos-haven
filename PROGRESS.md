# PROGRESS — Iqos Haven

## Current position

- Date: 2026-10-09
- Milestone: M2 — shared reliability, communication and audit foundation (M0 review and M1 staging/fixtures still open)
- Step: 27 (identity schema + permission seeds) — done; Milestone 3 started
- Branch: `step/27-identity-schema` (from `main`)
- See docs/verification.md for actual checks.

## Next action

Run `/step 28`: one-time first-Owner bootstrap + argon2id password hashing (identity service; benchmark parameters; no default/prototype password; re-running bootstrap must never create another Owner without authorization; audit the bootstrap). BI-11 (real Owner account details) is needed to run it for real — build the command so the Owner's email/name come from the operator at run time, never from the repo. Services must bump `staff_users.version` explicitly (no trigger). Also pending decision: close the M2 gate. Use node@24 PATH; start Docker Desktop before `pnpm infra:up`.

## Blockers

None for step 27 (schema). BI-11 blocks real Owner bootstrap (28). Email go-live needs the rest of BI-07 (verified Resend domain, sender address, new-order recipients). Audit retention/pruning needs BI-08. BI-07 is partially answered; the other BI items remain open; M0 needs client decisions; M1 staging needs BI-06.

## Gates passed

None closed. M2 gate condition (synthetic event processed by worker; duplicate delivery + Redis job-loss recovery; tests send no real email) is demonstrated locally and in CI (PR #1, run 37818768532); Milestone 2 still has steps 25–26 open. M0/M1 remain open.

## Steps done

- Baseline — corrected foundation, Chainguard MinIO images, turbo concurrency — 5e11c40
- 18 — append-only `audit_log`, redacted domain diff, `AuditWriter` port, `PrismaAuditWriter` (unit-of-work only), write-only API `AuditService` — 619b1fe
- 19 — `outbox_events`/`consumer_effects` with DB-enforced completion/dead/replay/prune rules; contracts event catalogue + `defineEvent` — 702f11a
- 20 — `EventWriter` port, `PrismaOutboxWriter`, API `OutboxService` (`ReliabilityModule`) — b220ca5
- 21 — worker runtime/shutdown, INFO-based noeviction + memory monitor, BullMQ options/prefix, cache≠queue guard — 0375223
- 22 — leased outbox relay (SKIP LOCKED claim, enqueue outside tx, stable job IDs, backoff) — 85d0487
- 23 — EffectRunner (lease claim, one-tx completion, retry/dead, heartbeat, external receipts), DB-clock timestamp defaults — 1781c95
- 24 — EffectReconciler, dead listing + audited replay, scheduled_runs + Scheduler, colon-free job IDs; M2 gate demo — 7769a8f
- fix — DB-clock completion for zero-consumer events, reconciler per-status query + indexes, loopback Redis guard (bug log in docs/verification.md) — 7e879c5
- ci — actions/checkout v7, setup-node v7, pnpm/action-setup v6 (Node 24 runtimes) — b31ad60 (PR #2)
- 25 — email pipeline (strict env, templates, delivery key, EmailConsumer, SMTP/disabled/allowlist adapters, Mailpit in CI) — f35e3dc (PR #4)
- feat — Resend adapter, EMAIL_PROVIDER/RESEND_* config, BI-07 partial + ADR 0004 — PR #5 (c088bb9)
- 26 — @ih/platform storage + HMAC service auth, API InternalService guard, MinIO least-privilege user, MinIO in CI — PR #6 (c786eda)
- 27 — identity schema, explicit Owner/Staff permission seeds, lockable-but-immutable roles — uncommitted (commit `step(27)` follows this handoff)

## Known deviations

- Local MinIO uses Chainguard rebuilds (`cgr.dev/chainguard/minio`, `minio-client:latest-dev`) pinned by digest because official MinIO images are no longer publicly pullable. Still MinIO; production storage provider is decided under BI-06. No ADR needed unless the provider changes.
- Event `consumers` lists only implemented consumers (now `system_probe`); planned ones are documented with roadmap steps and move in with a backfill decision (architecture §8: adding a consumer must not redefine old completions).
- `audit_log` migration revokes UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE only from a role named `ih_app`; other runtime role names must be revoked at provisioning (trigger blocks mutations regardless).

## Last session handoff (2026-10-09, step 27)

Done: step 27. Permission catalogue lives in `@ih/domain` (`PERMISSIONS`, `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`); the identity migration seeds were generated from it and an integration test keeps them equal. `invariant-reviewer`: one blocker (runtime role could not lock the owner role row) fixed with a column-level UPDATE grant + immutability trigger, verified as `ih_app` on the dev DB; should-fix applied (privilege tests use production-like default privileges, fail in CI if `ih_app` is missing; CI creates `ih_app`). Nits deferred: session expiry index (with the sweep job), explicit `version` bumps in services. The unreleased identity migration was rolled back and re-applied locally once during the fix.

Tests: `pnpm verify -- --integration` PASS (domain 66, db int 38).

Unfinished: bootstrap/hashing (28), gateway (29), sessions/login (30), guards (31), CSRF/limits (32), reset (33), invites (34), staff admin (35), last-Owner guard (36).
