# PROGRESS — Iqos Haven

## Current position

- Date: 2026-10-10
- Milestone: M3 — identity, permissions, admin access and basic settings (M0 review and M1 staging/fixtures still open)
- Step: 38 (typed store/contact/notification/WhatsApp settings schema + Owner-only API) — done; step 37 visual browser QA pending
- Branch: `step/38-settings-api` (based on local step 37 commit `f0071e8`; merge dependency PRs in step order)
- See docs/verification.md for actual checks.

## Next action

Implement `/step 39`: delivery areas, flat fees and ETA schema/API, using the roadmap and delivery/settings contracts. Keep unanswered BI-03 real areas/fees/ETA unconfigured; enforce strict bounded inputs, current permissions, expected versions and atomic audit/outbox. Step 37 desktop/mobile browser QA remains pending (Computer Use unavailable). Review/push completed branches through green CI in step order (32–38).

## Blockers

None for step 38 implementation or step 39 schema/API. Real settings need BI-01/BI-09 and remaining BI-07 contact, sender and recipient inputs; real delivery configuration needs BI-03. Step 37 browser QA remains blocked by unavailable browser surface/Computer Use permission. BI-11 blocks real Owner bootstrap; BI-06 blocks staging provisioning. No milestone gate changes.

## Gates passed

- **M2 — PASSED 2026-10-09** (closed on Marina's approval). Gate: a synthetic event is written and processed by the worker; duplicate delivery and Redis job loss are recovered; tests send no real email. Evidence: `apps/worker/src/recovery.int.test.ts` "M2 gate" (queue obliterated → reconciler re-enqueue + duplicate original job → effect completed exactly once), `effects.int.test.ts` (5 concurrent duplicates apply once), real dev orphan recovered by the built worker (step 24 notes in docs/verification.md); email only to Mailpit/stubs. CI green on `main` at a2429f7 (run 37894960188) with all steps 18–26 merged. Not part of this gate: production queue Redis failover/restore drills (M11, after BI-06).
- M0, M1 and M3–M11: not passed.

## Known deviations

- Local MinIO uses Chainguard rebuilds (`cgr.dev/chainguard/minio`, `minio-client:latest-dev`) pinned by digest because official MinIO images are no longer publicly pullable. Still MinIO; production storage provider is decided under BI-06. No ADR needed unless the provider changes.
- Event `consumers` lists only implemented consumers (now `system_probe` and `email`); planned ones are documented with roadmap steps and move in with a backfill decision (architecture §8: adding a consumer must not redefine old completions).
- `audit_log` migration revokes UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE only from a role named `ih_app`; other runtime role names must be revoked at provisioning (trigger blocks mutations regardless).

## Last session handoff (2026-10-10, step 38)

Done: step 38 settings schema/API (ADR 0011). Four groups are explicit null/version 0 until configured; no prototype or real values seeded. Owner-only GET/PATCH uses strict complete-group contracts, current `settings.manage`, no-store responses and fail-closed mutation limits.

- Additive settings migration: allowed immutable keys, bounded positive versions, JSON object/null and Staff actor FK. Expected version 0 creates version 1; competing creates/updates conflict; unchanged replacements preserve metadata; null clears preserve version history.
- Transactions lock the Owner role, actor and setting in order, recheck authority and atomically save settings, metadata-only audit and IDs-only `settings.updated` outbox. Audit/outbox contain no contact, recipient or template content. No email delivery or WhatsApp automation activated.
- Strict domains, HTTPS social links without credentials, E.164 numbers, bounded email recipients and approved template placeholders. Only implemented new-order email configuration is exposed; low-stock/daily digest remain deferred. Invariant reviewer: no issues.

Tests: `pnpm verify -- --integration` PASS (unit 297, integration 180, gateway 29), including production builds/lint/typecheck/format/boundary/reference/infra/contract checks. Eight new real Nest/PostgreSQL integration tests cover authorization, strict inputs, concurrent creation/version conflicts/no-ops, null clear, audit privacy/rollback, DB constraints, deterministic actor-demotion lock race and shared-limiter outage. All migrations applied only to isolated test schemas. Initial DTO typing and generated-contract formatting failures fixed before the green full run; generator now uses the repository Prettier config.

Unfinished: step 39 delivery configuration, step 40 admin forms/auth acceptance and step 37 browser visual/interactive QA. Real settings/delivery inputs pending. No live migration, `.env` changes, new dependencies, real email/identities, PR push/merge or M3 gate closure.
