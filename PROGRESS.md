# PROGRESS — Iqos Haven

## Current position

- Date: 2026-10-09
- Milestone: M2 — shared reliability, communication and audit foundation (M0 review and M1 staging/fixtures still open)
- Step: 30 (admin sign-in + sessions) — done
- Branch: `step/30-auth-sessions` (from `main`)
- See docs/verification.md for actual checks.

## Next action

Run `/step 31`: permission guard + response field filtering: `@RequirePermission("...")` decorator + `PermissionGuard` on top of `AuthGuard` (deny by default for admin routes without a declared permission), and a serializer/field-filter mechanism that strips Owner-only fields (e.g. aggregate spend, revenue) for Staff. Every new endpoint needs allowed-role, denied-role and invalid-input integration tests (apps/api/CLAUDE.md). Pending decision: close the M2 gate. Use node@24 PATH; start Docker Desktop before `pnpm infra:up`.

## Blockers

None for step 27 (schema). BI-11 blocks real Owner bootstrap (28). Email go-live needs the rest of BI-07 (verified Resend domain, sender address, new-order recipients). Audit retention/pruning needs BI-08. BI-07 is partially answered; the other BI items remain open; M0 needs client decisions; M1 staging needs BI-06.

## Gates passed

- **M2 — PASSED 2026-10-09** (closed on Marina's approval). Gate: a synthetic event is written and processed by the worker; duplicate delivery and Redis job loss are recovered; tests send no real email. Evidence: `apps/worker/src/recovery.int.test.ts` "M2 gate" (queue obliterated → reconciler re-enqueue + duplicate original job → effect completed exactly once), `effects.int.test.ts` (5 concurrent duplicates apply once), real dev orphan recovered by the built worker (step 24 notes in docs/verification.md); email only to Mailpit/stubs. CI green on `main` at a2429f7 (run 37894960188) with all steps 18–26 merged. Not part of this gate: production queue Redis failover/restore drills (M11, after BI-06).
- M0, M1 and M3–M11: not passed.

- 26 — @ih/platform storage + HMAC service auth, API InternalService guard, MinIO least-privilege user, MinIO in CI — PR #6 (c786eda)
- 27 — identity schema, explicit Owner/Staff permission seeds, lockable-but-immutable roles — PR #7 (2bbe336)

- 29 — Caddy same-origin gateway, header stripping, `pnpm test:gateway` (29 checks) in verify/CI — PR #9 (d494dc0)
- 30 — login/logout/me, `__Host-ih_admin` sessions, AuthGuard — uncommitted (commit `step(30)` follows this handoff)

## Known deviations

- Local MinIO uses Chainguard rebuilds (`cgr.dev/chainguard/minio`, `minio-client:latest-dev`) pinned by digest because official MinIO images are no longer publicly pullable. Still MinIO; production storage provider is decided under BI-06. No ADR needed unless the provider changes.
- Event `consumers` lists only implemented consumers (now `system_probe`); planned ones are documented with roadmap steps and move in with a backfill decision (architecture §8: adding a consumer must not redefine old completions).
- `audit_log` migration revokes UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE only from a role named `ih_app`; other runtime role names must be revoked at provisioning (trigger blocks mutations regardless).

## Last session handoff (2026-10-09, step 30)

Done: step 30. `invariant-reviewer`: no blockers; should-fixes applied (one argon2 verify on the over-length path; dummy hash warmed at startup; `no-store` on errors confirmed by tests — the global error filter already sets it) and nits (duplicate-cookie scan, logout revokes every presented token, re-login revokes the previous session, session insert conditional on the verified hash + active user). Test seam: `createApp(env, { pool, database })` for isolated-schema API integration tests (production never passes it).

Tests: `pnpm verify -- --integration` PASS (unit 263, integration 101, gateway 29).

Unfinished: permission guard/field filtering (31), Origin/CSRF + login rate limits (32), password reset (33), invites (34), staff admin (35), last-Owner service (36), admin UI (37).
